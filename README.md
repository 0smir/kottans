# Pokedex

##Here is my test work for Kottans!

**http://0smir.github.io/kottans/**

My app doesn't require ane special build steps for using. Simply put all files together and open index.html.

I used: 
* Bootstrap and media queries - for make it responsive, 
* Handlebars - compile identical html code for each pokemon wiht help of templates, 
* jQuery library â€“ to get json data from http://pokeapi.co, for DOM manipulation and event handling.
